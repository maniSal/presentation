I created a MERN application that simulation an E-learning platform :
1) Home : 
The home page gives the user the ability to Login , register ,check the About Us and the Contact Us pages .
2) About Us : 
A page that gives a brief description about the platform 
3) Contact Us : 
Is a form to Contact the platform. 
4) Login : 
We have 2 roles the admin and the User ( students) 
5) Register 
The user can not discover courses if he is not registered before 
6) Profile 
# Admin Profile: 
The admin has a profile that gives him the ability of get any user (Dashboard button) and delete it.
 (since the user do not have many information I didn't add the details button )
*** Add courses :
The button add cours shows a form to add new cours to the courses list .
*** the admin could apply all the CRUD functions on the courses ( Create / Read /Edit /Delete )
 # User profile : 
***The law of my platform gives cours only for the registered user ( user named gomycode ) the profil show a card with the user information and the available courses .
*** a cours is a card (title , level , content)with details button.
The last two screens show the database. 
# The last step was the deployment using render and netlify 
Thank you
